I am working as a senior research scientist in <a href="https://www.hifo.uzh.ch/en/research/karayannis.html" style="color:#45809b">Laboratory of Neural Circuit Assembly </a>, <a href="https://www.hifo.uzh.ch" style="color:#45809b">Brain Research Institute</a>, University of Zurich.

I studied biomedical engineering in <a href="https://www.baskent.edu.tr/en" style="color:#45809b">Başkent University</a> and went on to do my masters in
Electronics Engineering and Computer Science in <a href="http://labs.sabanciuniv.edu/spis/" style="color:#45809b">Signal Processing and Information Systems Laboratory</a> at Sabancı University in İstanbul, Türkiye. After working on developing machine learning algorithms for EEG brain computer inferfaces, I decided to focus on more about the brain and moved to Portugal for Ph.D. During my Ph.D. in <a href="http://neuro.fchampalimaud.org" style="color:#45809b">Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme </a>, I studied how different activity patterns lead to diverse structural plasticity at single dendritic spines using two photon glutamate uncaging and imaging.
