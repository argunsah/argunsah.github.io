I am working as a senior research scientist in <a href="https://www.hifo.uzh.ch/en/research/karayannis.html" style="color:#45809b">Laboratory of Neural Circuit Assembly </a>, <a href="https://www.hifo.uzh.ch" style="color:#45809b">Brain Research Institute</a>, University of Zurich. I am involved in two separate but interconnected lines of
research: Systems neuroscience and data analysis. We are trying to understand how different neuronal types and system interact during the course of development.

I studied biomedical engineering in <a href="https://www.baskent.edu.tr/en" style="color:#45809b">Başkent University</a> and went on to do my masters in
Electronics Engineering and Computer Science in <a href="http://labs.sabanciuniv.edu/spis/" style="color:#45809b">Signal Processing and Information Systems Laboratory</a> at Sabancı University in İstanbul, Türkiye. I worked on developing machine learning algorithms for EEG brain computer inferfaces under the supervision of Dr. Müjdat Çetin.

During my masters, I spent six months in <a href="https://www.neurostat.mit.edu" style="color:#45809b">Neuroscience statistics lab</a>, working on epilepsy onset and offset detection using ECoG data recorded from patiens with temporal lobe epilepsy. I also audit Introduction to Neuroscience course at Harvard Medical School. After this visit, I got more interested in Neuroscience and decided to switch my research direction from signal processing to neuroscience.

I moved to Lisbon, Portugal ın 2009 for Ph.D. During my Ph.D. in <a href="https://fchampalimaud.org/champalimaud-research" style="color:#45809b">Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme </a>, I studied how different activity patterns lead to diverse structural plasticity at single dendritic spines using two photon glutamate uncaging and imaging.
