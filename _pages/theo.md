Professor Theofanis Karayannis is an Associate Professor of Neuroscience and Co-Director of the Brain Research Institute at the University of Zurich. He earned his Pharmacy degree from the University of Athens, Greece, and completed his D.Phil. at the University of Oxford, UK, focusing on cortical interneurons. During his postdoctoral fellowship at New York University Medical Center, USA, he investigated the synaptic integration of interneurons in developing cortical circuits and neurodevelopmental disorders. His research centers on understanding how environmental factors influence the assembly and plasticity of neuronal circuits, particularly those involved in sensory information processing. Professor Karayannis has been recognized with a NARSAD award and an ERC Starting Grant for his contributions to neuroscience.
